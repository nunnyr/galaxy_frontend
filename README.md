### About

🪐 Stellar Galaxy Mission is a fullstack app that allows users to choose different planets located in the Milky Way(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way). This app was created with three models using object relationship mapping.

### Features
🪐 Users are able to browse Planets and view information pertaining to each one.  

🪐 When users select a "Book A Galaxy Trip" users will be redirected to fill out their user information. This information is saved to our Rails backend. Profile information includes: pronouns, first name, last name, age, and email.  

🪐 Users are able to then select Planets from the next page.
  Users are able to book their one way trip  by selecting
  * Two planets 
  * A date on a calendar

🪐 Users will be able to see their trip confirmation after booking and when they log in. 


### Getting Started
To use our fullstack app, users will open their terminal and run the following commands for two different repos:

For the backend it is crucial that you first `bundle install`. Next steps: 
* `rails db:create` 
* `rails db:migrate` 
* `rails db:seed` 
* `rails s`

To run the frontend repo
* Have the rails server running on "localhost:3000"
* Open `index.html`

### Next Steps
1. We would like to include even more Galaxies and then choose a Planet based on the Galaxy. 

2. Work on making this model accessible using accessibility tools.

3. Incorporate additional models.

4. Create rspec files to test our fullstack model.

5. Add more validations for forms.
